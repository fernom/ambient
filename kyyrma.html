			<p><strong><span><span>Composing Ambient Tracks for Dummies</span></span></strong></p><p><span>v. 1.0 or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Make the Ambient</span></p><p>This tutorial shows you my method for creating ambient sound without any previous musical talent or experience in using audio editors required. The guide will be fleshed out as I learn more about the process and everyone is welcome to contribute. Feel free to add your own comments and suggestions in the thread.</p><p>These are type of ambient tracks that have been created with my methods:</p><p><a href="http://www.student.oulu.fi/~mkyyro/Haunted_ground_loop.ogg" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Haunted Ground</a></p><p><a href="http://www.student.oulu.fi/~mkyyro/Home_asleep.ogg" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Home Asleep</a></p><p><a href="http://www.student.oulu.fi/~mkyyro/Creaking.ogg" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Creaking</a></p><p><span><span><strong>What tools do you need?</strong></span></span></p><ul><li><a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/?lang=fi" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Audacity</a> (Free: Win/Mac/Linux)<br></li><li><a href="http://freesound.org/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Freesound.org</a> (Either sign up for a free account or <a href="http://bugmenot.com/view/freesound.org" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">get one here</a>)<br></li><li>A good pair of headphones<br></li><li>4-6 hours of free time<br></li></ul><p>For best results follow the tutorial twice: once following my directions exactly with the samples I provide, and then a second time picking your own samples and making your own choices in how to modify them.</p><p>With these simple tools and a bit of patience you too can produce your own ambient track with relative ease. Just don't expect to become Eric Brosius overnight. Remember to save your project between between sections, and don't worry about completing everything in day.</p><p><span><span><strong>I. Planning and preparation</strong></span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>II. Choosing the ambient base</strong></span></span></p><div data-ipsspoiler="" id="ips_uid_6387_13"> 	<p><a href="#" data-action="toggleSpoiler">&nbsp;</a>		<span>Hide contents</span>	</p><div><p>For our base ambient we want to pick a long recording that also has some melody or variance to it. This means that it is not just one long flat note, but that there is some variance in pitch and progression in the recording. For our tutorial we are creating audio for an outdoors area, so a recording of the wind howling could be a good starting point.</p><p>1. Go to <a href="http://freesound.org/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Freesound.org</a></p><p>2. Use the search on the right hand side to look for "wind howling"</p><p>3. Filter the search results by Creative Commons 0 license: this means you are free to use the audio however you please</p><p>4. Listen to the different samples available to you</p><p>5. Download a sample of your liking into whichever folder you want to store your samples in</p><p>For our cemetary example I picked the following <a href="http://freesound.org/people/felix.blume/sounds/217394/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">recording of an electric pole under stress from the wind</a>.</p><p>6. Add the sample to your Audacity project by simply dragging and dropping the file into your open Audacity window</p><p>Now is a good time to get comfortable with the basic controls of Audacity. In the top-left of the window you see the playback controls. You can use that at any time to play and preview the audio you are working on. Try playing a part of the sample you just downloaded.</p></div></div><p><span><span><strong>III. Effects in Audacity</strong></span></span></p><div data-ipsspoiler="" id="ips_uid_6387_14"> 	<p><a href="#" data-action="toggleSpoiler">&nbsp;</a>		<span>Hide contents</span>	</p><div><p>Before we start applying effects to our base ambient track, let's take a quick look at the tools at our disposal. All the effects are found under the Effects menu in the top bar of Audacity.</p><ul><li><strong>Fade in / Fade out:</strong> Used to smooth the transition to and from a sound effect. Use these to avoid clicks or sudden spikes when layering audio samples on top of each other.<br></li><li><strong>Echo:</strong> Exactly what it says on the tin - adds an echo effect with your specified delay.<br></li><li><strong>Noise Removal:</strong> Used to remove noise from low-quality recordings, but can be used to achieve all sorts of effects. Select an element you would like removed from the track by highlighting it in the track.  Now open Noise Removal and choose "Get noise profile." Next highlight the part of the track you want that element to be removed from and execute the effect. Experimenting with this effect can produce interesting changes in your audio tracks.<br></li><li><strong>Repeat:</strong> Can be used to loop a highlighted part of the track multiple times.<br></li><li><strong>Change Tempo / Speed / Pitch:</strong> These three effects are your main tools in modifying the audio samples. Change Pitch adjusts the frequency of the audio: usually ambients tend to be in the lower frequencies. Change Tempo changes the speed of the audio without affecting the pitch. To adjust the speed and the pitch at the same time, use Change Speed instead.<br></li><li><strong>Paulstretch:</strong> Stretches out the highlighted piece of audio. You can produce very cool ambient sound by stretching short pieces of audio. Try stretching something like a piano key strike or a single string of the violin to 10-20 seconds.<br></li><li><strong>Reverb:</strong> Produces a similar but much more subtle effect to echo by simulating how sound traverses in a closed space. Gives your audio more oomph and makes it more organic sounding, which is a must for a good ambient track. You might want to apply this effect to specific tracks or after the whole project has been put to together depending on the samples you are using.<br></li><li><strong>Reverse:</strong> This flips the audio temporally. Many common everyday sounds  produce interesting results when played in reverse. Try things like creaking doors, musical instruments and even spoken word.<br></li><li><strong>Amplify:</strong> Used to make a sound louder or more quiet.</li></ul></div></div>&nbsp;<p><span><span><strong>IV. Applying effects on a track</strong></span></span></p><div data-ipsspoiler="" id="ips_uid_6387_15"> 	<p><a href="#" data-action="toggleSpoiler">&nbsp;</a>		<span>Hide contents</span>	</p><div><p>The sample we picked for the purposes of this tutorial is somewhat high-pitched, so let's go ahead and lower its frequency a bit.</p><p>1. Double-click on your track in Audacity to highlight it.</p><p>To use effects in Audacity you always need to have a part of the audio highlighted, otherwise the effect will be applied to all active tracks in the window.  I will not repeat this step again in the instructions, so try to keep it in mind.</p><p>2. Open Effects &gt; Change Pitch and apply a -80 percent reduction in pitch (the last input box in the Change Pitch dialog)</p><p>Notice how different the track sounds now? Instead of the earlier high pitched wind and screaming of metal we are left with a much more subtle hum.</p><p>You can always revert the track by pressing Ctrl + Z to undo your last change. Go ahead and try out the Change Pitch effect with different values to get a feel for how pitch affects the audio track. Just make sure you move on to the next step with just a single -80 percent reduction in pitch as instructed.</p><p>The tempo of is still a bit too fast for our haunting cemetary theme, so let's slow it down a bit.</p><p>4. Open Effects &gt; Change Speed and apply a -35 percent reduction in speed</p><p>The track should now sound significantly slower then before. Just like in the last step, you can undo the change and try out different Change Speed values to get a sense of how the effect modifies the track. Just make sure you move on to the next section with just a single -35 percent reduction.</p></div></div><p><span><span><strong>V. Trimming, copying &amp; pasting</strong></span></span></p><div data-ipsspoiler="" id="ips_uid_6387_16"> 	<p><a href="#" data-action="toggleSpoiler">&nbsp;</a>		<span>Hide contents</span>	</p><div><p>With all the slowing down our base ambient track has gotten way too long. The average ambient loop can be as long as just a minute, but naturally a longer track is less prone to being repeative.</p><p>1. To trim down your track, highlight about a minute worth of audio from the beginning and use Ctrl + X to cut it out.</p><p>2. Next click in empty space in the window to deselect everything and then use Ctrl + V to paste the audio on its own track.</p><p>3. You can now close the leftovers of the original audio track by pressing the small X in the top left.</p><p>At this point it would be a good idea to save your work. Go to File &gt; Save Project and save your work so far.</p></div></div><p><span><span><strong>VI. Layering</strong></span></span></p><div data-ipsspoiler="" id="ips_uid_6387_12"> 	<p><a href="#" data-action="toggleSpoiler">&nbsp;</a>		<span>Hide contents</span>	</p><div><p>The trick to a good ambient is in layering a different audio tracks together. We have our base ambient ready, but lets go ahead and add another layer of audio on top of it.</p><p>1. Download a sample and drag and drop it into your project</p><p>For our haunted cemetary ambient I picked a <a href="http://freesound.org/people/daboy291/sounds/138082/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">sample of rustling an empty garbage bag</a> that turned up as I search for "rustling" on <a href="https://www.freesound.org/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Freesound.org</a>. If this is your first time going through the tutorial, you might want to use the same sample as I did - otherwise feel free to find your own.</p><p>Note that when you drop the new track in Audacity, the level of zoom might change. Use Ctrl + Mousewheel up and down to adjust the zoom level.</p><p>2. Mute the main ambient track so we can focus on editing the new track</p><p>You can find the mute control on the left-hand side of each track. The mute button allows you to individually mute any track which will come in handy when previewing different combinations or working on a single track.</p><p>3. Use Effects &gt; Change Speed and stretch the rustling sample to roughly the same length as the base ambient track</p><p>If your base ambient track is about one minute in length, a reduction of -80 percent in speed should be about right. Now the resulting audio would be perfect for a rockslide! That doesn't exactly fit with our haunted theme however, so let's go ahead and modify the sound further</p><p>4. Use Effects &gt; Change Pitch and lower the frequency by -60 percent</p><p>The resulting audio should now sound more akin to a thunderstorm. This could work well for a rainy level, but for now let's go ahead and apply another effect.</p><p>5. Use Effects &gt; Paulstretch and apply the effect with a Stretch Factor of 1 and Time Resolution of 2</p><p>In addition to stretching sound (the sound is stretched to the power of the Stretch Factor) the Paulstretch effect can be used to smear tracks by using a high Time Resolution with a Stretch Factor of 1. The resulting audio is now a smooth but rather loud monsoon type of wind.</p><p>At this point we should try and listen to the two tracks layered together.</p><p>6. Unmute the main ambient track and play the project.</p><p>You should instantly notice that the track we have modified from the rustling garbage bag sound is now overpowering the main ambient. This is where the individual volume sliders come handy: you can use the volume slider on the left-hand side of each track to change its volume.</p><p>7. Adjust the volume of the second track until it doesn't overpower the main ambient (the track is very loud, so up to -30dB)</p></div></div><p><span><span><strong>VII. Adding Instruments</strong></span></span></p><div data-ipsspoiler="" id="ips_uid_6387_17"> 	<p><a href="#" data-action="toggleSpoiler">&nbsp;</a>		<span>Hide contents</span>	</p><div><p>By instruments I mean shorter samples that are used to give the ambient track structure. In general you want to avoid making an ambient track too rhytmic or melodic, as that will easily make it sound repeative. Yet we still need to break up the monotony of the final track somehow and give it depth.</p><p>For the purpose of our haunted cemetary I picked a recording of <a href="http://freesound.org/people/squashy555/sounds/252693/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">a power tool cutting metal</a> that I found when looking for a violin sound - a good reminder on how a variety of everyday sounds can be modified into interesting ambient sound texture.</p><p>Let's go ahead and start modifying our power tool track into screams of the haunted:</p><p>1. Add the sample to your project and mute the two previous tracks</p><p>2. Use Effects &gt; Paulstretch on the track with a Stretch Factor of 2 and Time Resolution of 0.25</p><p>The stretched out track sounds more like shrieking mandrakes then the type of howl I had in mind, but let's go on ahead and cut a few good shrieks out from there.</p><p>3. Highlight and use Ctrl + X and Ctrl + V to place a total of three individual shrieks on their own track, and then close the remaining power tool track. <a href="http://www.student.oulu.fi/~mkyyro/isolated_shrieks.jpg" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">This is what the result should look like.</a></p><p>4. Slow down the shrieks by individually applying Change Speed on all of them: highlight a single shriek and then change the speed by -30 to -50 percent.</p><p>5. Make the shrieks into a low howling by individually applying Change Pitch on all of them: highlight a single shriek and then change the pitch by -80 to -90 percent.</p><p>6. Give the (now) howls an individual volume by using Effects &gt; Amplify and changing the volume by +-5dB</p><p>Amplify can be used to both make a sound louder or more quiet.</p><p>Giving each shriek it's individual values will make them stand out from each other and give your track variety. Next we will need to find out how they sound with the other two tracks.</p><p>6. Unmute the two previous tracks and listen to the whole project layered.</p><p>The first thing you will hear is that the howling track is too loud, so go ahead and reduce the volume of  the track by 25dB or so. Even then the howls don't seem to mesh too well with the two other tracks, so let's address that next.</p></div></div><p><span><span><strong>VIII. Adding Fade-ins and Fade-outs</strong></span></span></p><div data-ipsspoiler="" id="ips_uid_6387_18"> 	<p><a href="#" data-action="toggleSpoiler">&nbsp;</a>		<span>Hide contents</span>	</p><div><p>Fade-ins and Fade-outs can be used to smoothen samples that are played on top of the ambient tracks.</p><p>1. On the howl track, highlight half of a single howl from the left side and then use Effects &gt; Fadein.</p><p>2. For the same howl, highlight the right half and use Effects &gt; Fade out.</p><p>3. Repeat the same process for the two remaining howls.</p><p>The howls should now mesh with the other audio much better, but let's keep on layering more sounds on top.</p></div></div><p><span><span><strong>IX. Adding Instruments pt. 2</strong></span></span></p><div data-ipsspoiler="" id="ips_uid_6387_19"> 	<p><a href="#" data-action="toggleSpoiler">&nbsp;</a>		<span>Hide contents</span>	</p><div><p>While the howls break up the monotony of our track somewhat, the project still feels flat. It needs a bit of melody and high pitched samples to break to give it more structure. To fit our haunted cemetary theme, I picked a recording of <a href="http://freesound.org/people/vumseplutten1709/sounds/216541/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">bells being rang</a>. Go ahead and drop that into your project in Audacity and mute the rest of the tracks as before.</p><p>This recording has an amplifying bell sound, so it's not exactly suited for our to-be looping ambient. Let's cut a piece from it to use in our project instead.</p><p>1. Use Ctrl + X to cut out two consecutive bell strikes from the beginning of the track.</p><p>2. Copy that over to a new track three times and then close the remaining bell sound track. <a href="http://www.student.oulu.fi/~mkyyro/isolated_bells.jpg" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">The result should look somewhat like this picture.</a></p><p>Try to place your bell strikes so that they fill empty gaps in the project. Remember that you have to keep adjusting the placement of the strikes as you apply different effects on them. You can use instruments to create different rythms, sequences and melodies into your ambient tracks.</p><p>3. Now let's modify the bell sounds using a combination of the tools you have learned so far:</p><ul><li>Paulstretch the sounds with a Stretch Factor of 2 and Time Resolution of the default 0.25<br></li><li>Slow the speed of each two strikes by 40 to 50 percent<br></li><li>Give each two strikes a slightly adjusted frequency<br></li><li>Add fade-ins and fade-outs to each two strikes<br></li></ul><p>To add even more layering to our ambient, let's create one more bell track from the one we have now:</p><p>4. Create a copy of the bell sounds track</p><p>5. Slow down the copied track by 50 percent</p><p>6. Adjust the hits on the slowed track so that they fit into the length of the base ambient</p><p><a href="http://www.student.oulu.fi/~mkyyro/final_project.jpg" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">This is what your final project in Audacity should look like.</a> At this point your project is almost done, go ahead and save it in a safe place.</p></div></div><p><strong><span><span>X. Mixing, Looping and Exporting</span></span></strong></p><div data-ipsspoiler="" id="ips_uid_6387_20"> 	<p><a href="#" data-action="toggleSpoiler">&nbsp;</a>		<span>Hide contents</span>	</p><div><p>Now it's time to finalize your project!</p><p>1. Adjust the volume of each track</p><p>For the final mixing you want to go and adjust the volume on each and every track one more time, making sure you get the volumes just right. Once you are satisfied with how the project sounds, let's go ahead and mix it together.</p><p>2. Press Ctrl + A to select all tracks and then use Tracks &gt; Mix and Render to compile them all into a single track</p><p>3. Use Effects &gt; Reverb to add a reverb effect on your track</p><p>Reverb will add a bit more oomph and organical sound to your track.</p><p><span><strong>Looping</strong></span></p><p><em>This simple but effective method is from Goldwell</em></p><p>1. Highlight about 5 seconds from the beginning of the track and use Effects &gt; Fade in</p><p>2. Highlight about 5 seconds from the end of the track and use Effects &gt; Fade out</p><p>3. Cut the last 5 seconds of the ambient and paste them on their own track</p><p>4. Use Tracks &gt; Mix and render to put the song back together</p><p>Your track should now be looping!</p><p><span><strong>Exporting</strong></span></p><p>The final thing left to do is exporting your project. Use File &gt; Export to save your ambient track as an .ogg.</p>
